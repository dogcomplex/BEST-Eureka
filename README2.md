A mashup of Eureka and PokemonRedExperiments.  Can an AI on a self-improvement reward-function-rewriting loop become the very best, like no one ever was?

## Installation:

(oh god)

Follow standard Eureka repo installation

add:

```
cd PokemonRedExperiments/baselines
conda env update --file requirements.yml --name eureka
```

## Execution

```
cd eureka
python eureka.py env=red_gym_env sample=4 iteration=10 model=gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
```

Probably a few more loose packages you'll see you're missing as you try and run it.  `conda install <pkgname>` should do the trick.

`eureka\outputs\eureka` folder will show you logs for each session, along with printouts of what's being sent to OpenAI API and PokemonRed outputs for each code variation.  Good for debugging execution errors in the poke code that aren't just being generated by ChatGPT

Generally calling structure goes:
```
# eureka/eureka.py
# calls openAI to get a pack of code samples:
 => PokemonRedExperiments/baselines/run_parallel_fast.py
 => spawns pokemon game instances (4 default) per code sample
 

Couple gotchas:
 - PokemonRedExperiments/baselines/red_gym_env.py is not actually used anymore (?), in lieu of
